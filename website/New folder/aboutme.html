        Hi there, I'm Julia! I'm an aspiring character designer currently working on getting my advanced degree in Graphic Design, and looking to pursue a bachelors in Game Design after I graduate from my current course. Character design and concept art have always been my greatest passion and I am working hard as a student right now so in the near future I will accomplish a career in that area. Although school is my main focus, I have been working as a freelance commission artist for two years, and this has taught me a lot along the way. I love fashion and drawing clothes, which definitely shows a lot in my art and my style, and I hope it comes across to you, as the viewer of my work how truly passionate and dedicated I am about art and everything surrounding it.
